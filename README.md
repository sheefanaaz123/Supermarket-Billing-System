# Supermarket-Billing-System

The supermarket billing system is a computerized way to keep track of what products customers have bought and how much money they have spent. The system can also generate receipts and reports that show how much money the store has made, how much it owes customers, and the names of people or companies to whom the store owes money.
A supermarket has a variety of different products that are sold to its customers. Each product has a price and a code that represents that product. Customers scan their grocery items at the checkout counter using scanners that cost the supermarket money and deduct the cost from the customer's bill. This system makes it very easy for the supermarket to keep track of its customers and how much each spends on groceries each month. It also makes it easy for the cashiers to make sure that the customer has received the correct amount of change when they are paying for their groceries. The cashier can use a supermarket billing system to issue receipts that can be saved in a customer database for future reference. 

Using C++, I constructed a Supermarket Billing System with Admin login and the ability to display, ammend, and add new products to the catalogue. We can place orders and produce bills. Product search using the name and description.
